The goal of this project is to give the user workouts based on the day

Monday: Workout A | Workout B

Tuesday: Abs and Cardio

Wednesday: Workout B | Workout A

Thursday: Abs and Cardio

Friday: Workout A | Workout B

Saturday: Abs and Cardio

Sunday: Abs and Cardio

Workout A and B alternate so on Monday you will do Workout A and then next monday you will do Workout B

The website displays each workout for you and will have a set of buttons under it to keep track of your progress. When you finish a set you can click one of the buttons and it will disappear, letting you know you completed the set.
